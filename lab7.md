# Week 7 Lab Report - Arthur
## Part 1

Task :  TestDocSearch.java, copy the test called testSearchCount, rename the new test to testSearchCount2 and change the query string being tested to tax rather than taxation.

```
Vim TestDocSearch.java  //go to the specific file
/testSearchCount        //search the specific method
[Enter]
K                       //go to previous line
Shift + V               //highight the line
J (x5)                  //selected the highlited line down by 5
Y                       // (yank), copy the file to the clipboard
J (x6)                  //go below the current method
P                       //paste the copy method from the clipboard
/testSearchCount        //search the specific name method
[Enter]
W                       //go to the very end of the word
I                       // go to insert mode
2                       // add "2" as a different method
[Esc]                   //execute from input to visual mode
:wq                     //save and quit
<Enter>                 //execute the :wq command save and quit 
```

## Part 2
task 2:    

Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?      

>Personally, I would prefer doing doing it in the vscode, presume that i have the scp command and other commands save in other file. For me doing it in the an IDE environment such as VScode works more conveniently as when i run the bash.sh and if it fails, it will point out the error and lead suggestion to patch up the error. In comparison doing it in terminal its more tedious,especially wehn trying to solve where the problem come from. Also to open one file to another i need to access and go out from one directory to another. While in VScode i can directly open all the file at once in different tab.

   
What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)  

>If there would be a project given, i would definitelty use through vscode, as the flexibility and easy operate makes it more desirable. Especially in a large project, there would be more files and debugging the program, by using vscode it would be more helpful and easier to oeprate.
